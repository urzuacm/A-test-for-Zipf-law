        "Given a vector *x* of positive real numbers, the statistic lmz proposed in Urzúa (2000) can be used to test for Zipf's law. Under the null hypothesis, **lmz** is asymptotically distributed as a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom, and so the probability value can be estimated accordingly. But if the number of observations is less or equal than 30, it is suggested to use instead the critical values given in Table 1 of that paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "The vector *x* does not need to be ordered, and only the observations greater or equal than a given value of mu are used to compute the statistic. This is handy because Zipf's law is typically rejected when *mu* (>= minimum element of x) is not close to the right tail of the distribution. Contrast the two examples given in the last section of Urzúa (2000)."

It is worth noticing, however, that such a law is a limit case among the distributions that exhibit a power-law behavior. To test for that behavior one could use the pwlaw statistic proposed in Urzúa (2020). The repository https://github.com/urzuacarlosm/A-test-for-power-law contains the Python and R codes\n"
